## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- SmartPerfetto now ships a signed, versioned Android Internals Knowledge Pack
  containing the projected body content of every AIW article, including draft,
  review, finalized, and deprecated workflow states.
- The CLI, backend startup worker, runtime health, and report pipeline can
  inspect, update, and attribute the Pack through a TUF-verified stable channel
  while retaining the bundled snapshot as an offline fallback.
- AI analysis can retrieve bounded Android internals background excerpts with
  provenance, redaction, privacy projection, and explicit separation from
  current-trace SQL/Skill evidence.

### Changed
- npm, Docker, source, and three-platform portable packages now carry the
  locked compressed Pack, its aggregate audit, licenses, trusted root, and
  channel configuration as runtime assets.
- Knowledge Pack references are projected into reports and session snapshots
  without exposing excerpt bodies through logs or streaming metadata.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- Docker builds normalize the OpenCode runtime link so the packaged provider
  entry remains usable across image layers.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Smart Profile can now compose user-authorized source repositories and
  external RAG knowledge independently or together, with pinned generations,
  consent modes, provenance, and fail-closed authorization.
- Provider-neutral run specifications align OpenAI Agents SDK, Pi Agent Core,
  OpenCode, and Claude-compatible runtimes across analysis, comparison,
  evidence verification, reports, snapshots, CLI output, and frontend chat.
- Evidence-first Android 17 rendering, camera, managed-heap, GPU-compute,
  kernel-wait, startup, and scrolling knowledge is backed by an expanded,
  deterministic real/constructed trace corpus.
- Cross-platform contracts cover Linux, macOS, Windows, Docker, the npm CLI,
  portable launchers, and the public Perfetto Agent Skill projection.

### Changed
- Smart scene selection, presentation, recovery, and prompt methodology are
  registry/template-driven, with final conclusions kept separate from
  evidence, reports, snapshots, and readable chat projections.
- The Perfetto UI uses unified analysis context and trace workspaces, with the
  committed frontend prebuild regenerated from the matching submodule commit.
- Trace listing, processor queues, report caching, source ingestion, RAG
  accounting, and registry reads now use bounded, cursor-based, lease-aware,
  or aggregate paths suitable for larger deployments.
- Public `/health` exposes only liveness and version; authenticated runtime and
  provider diagnostics are served by `/api/runtime-health`.
- The public Perfetto-Skills export now classifies all 101 Strategy/registry
  sources explicitly, exporting portable behavior while keeping product-only
  orchestration behind the SmartPerfetto boundary.

### Fixed
- Private source/RAG context now preserves tenant, workspace, user, consent,
  license, and provider-send boundaries through persistence, replay, SSE,
  reports, and snapshots without leaking intermediate model content.
- Provider endpoints enforce exact-origin allowlists, DNS/IP pinning, redirect
  revalidation, deadlines, and credential reconfirmation after origin changes.
- Cross-process trace-processor cleanup and port allocation no longer terminate
  another live instance or claim a port already held by the operating system.
- Chinese/English source and RAG controls, dual-trace language inheritance,
  narrow layouts, keyboard focus, and ARIA semantics remain consistent across
  partial-capability and error states.
- Machine-readable CLI commands preserve parseable stdout, while bootstrap,
  health, lifecycle, and cleanup diagnostics are routed to stderr.

## [1.0.21] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Smart Analysis Mode now starts with a scene-inventory preview for mixed-action
  traces, then lets users deep-dive all scenes or only startup, scrolling,
  click, navigation, device-state, or ANR ranges.
- Smart scene reconstruction now carries eligibility, confidence, context,
  verification, and report ids into the main AI chat so the frontend can render
  scoped analysis buttons before spending deep-dive tokens.
- Smart selected-scope E2E coverage now verifies startup and scrolling
  conclusions against the direct single-scene analysis path.

### Changed
- Smart deep dives reuse the dedicated scene strategies and full analysis mode
  for the selected scope, keeping Smart output close to explicit startup or
  scrolling analysis.
- Smart job evidence is projected into bounded report payloads, with omitted
  rows kept as out-of-band scene-job artifacts.
- The committed Perfetto UI prebuild was refreshed from the updated AI
  Assistant plugin bundle.

### Fixed
- Smart scrolling conclusions now preserve corrected deep-dive root causes when
  batch reason codes are superseded by stronger evidence such as shader
  pipeline or `postAndWait` signals.

### Added
- Fast / Full / Auto three-tier analysis mode routing via `options.analysisMode`
  (env-configurable per-turn timeouts, classifier fast-path via keyword rules).
- Scene reconstruction pipeline with independent `sceneStoryService`
  (JobRunner concurrency=3, Haiku-summarized `SceneReport`).
- State Timeline V1: four swim-lane track overlays (device/input/app/system).
- Trace comparison prototype: three conditional MCP tools, orthogonal
  comparison mode.
- Perfetto stdlib integration: 22 critical-preload tables, `list_stdlib_modules`
  MCP tool, `lookup_knowledge` for on-demand background knowledge.
- Deep root-cause analysis skills: `blocking_chain_analysis`,
  `binder_root_cause`, `startup_slow_reasons`, `frame_blocking_calls`.
- Android version diff analysis (system-behavior vs app-adaptation root causes).
- Scrolling jank taxonomy: 21 reason codes, 2 new skills.
- Trace data completeness: capability registry + session-init probing.

### Changed
- agentv3 is now the primary runtime (Claude Agent SDK orchestrator, 20 MCP tools).
- Six shell scripts under `scripts/`; typecheck + test:core covered by `/health`
  dashboard.

### Fixed
- `claudeRuntime.ts` SDK `query()` close-handle convention to prevent zombie
  trace_processor_shell subprocesses.
- Verifier tightened around shallow root causes (critical-severity findings
  must include a quantitative claim and ≥ 2 causal chains).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added
- Initial public repository structure.
- Perfetto fork submodule (`perfetto/`) with custom UI plugin
  `com.smartperfetto.AIAssistant`.
- Backend Express service with SSE streaming, in-memory session management,
  and trace_processor_shell integration.
- YAML skill system (`backend/skills/`) with L1–L4 layered results and
  `DataEnvelope` v2.0 contract.
- Scene classifier (12 scenes: scrolling / startup / anr / pipeline / memory /
  game / teaching / interaction / touch-tracking / overview / scroll-response /
  general) driven by strategy front-matter.
- Strategy + template system under `backend/strategies/` (`*.strategy.md`,
  `*.template.md`) with hot reload in dev mode.
- HTML report generation and CSV / JSON export.
- AGPL v3.0 licensing throughout.
