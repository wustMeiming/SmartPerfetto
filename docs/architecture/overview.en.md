# Architecture Overview

[English](overview.en.md) | [中文](overview.md)

SmartPerfetto adds an AI analysis layer on top of Perfetto UI. Perfetto remains responsible for trace loading, timeline exploration, and SQL fundamentals; the SmartPerfetto backend handles agent orchestration, Skill execution, report generation, and streaming output.

## Product Entry Points And Release Forms

| Entry point | User form | Runtime boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Web UI | Docker, portable packages, source `./start.sh` | Calls the backend over HTTP/SSE and serves the committed `frontend/` prebuild |
| CLI | npm package `@gracker/smartperfetto` | Requires Node.js `>=24 <25`, does not start the Web UI, stores sessions/reports under `~/.smartperfetto/` |
| API/SSE | `/api/agent/v1/*` and related routes | Shared by the frontend and external integrations |
| Portable launcher | GitHub three-platform assets | Bundles Node.js 24, native deps, backend, `frontend/`, and `trace_processor_shell` |
| Docker | Docker Hub image | Linux container; does not read host Claude Code local auth |

Feature and bug designs must check Web UI, CLI, API, reports, Docker, portable
packages, runtime/provider behavior, pre-built content, and Node version
boundaries. The LLM/agent checklist is in
[`../../.claude/rules/product-surface.md`](../../.claude/rules/product-surface.md).

## Main Analysis Data Flow

```text
1. User loads a trace
   UI -> /api/traces/upload -> TraceProcessorService -> trace_processor_shell

2. User starts analysis
   UI -> POST /api/agent/v1/analyze
      -> AgentAnalyzeSessionService.prepareSession()
      -> selected runtime analyze()

3. Agent gathers evidence
   Runtime -> MCP tools
      -> execute_sql -> trace_processor_shell
      -> invoke_skill -> SkillExecutor -> SQL / DataEnvelope
      -> lookup_knowledge / lookup_sql_schema / fetch_artifact
      -> lookup_blog_knowledge(source=android_internals_wiki)
         -> request source allowlist + live registry consent/scope check
         -> active RAG generation -> bounded attributed background context
      -> resolve_symbol / lookup_app_source / lookup_aosp_source / lookup_kernel_source
         -> LookupResponseFilter -> CodeRef metadata
      -> propose_patch -> PatchProposer -> verified / sketch / unverified

4. Result normalization and quality artifacts
   raw runtime result -> agentResultNormalizer
      -> final_report_contract gate
      -> evidence contract / claim verification / identity resolutions

5. Backend streams output
   SDK events -> runtime bridge -> StreamProjector -> SSE
      -> frontend renders progress, tables, thoughts, answer tokens

6. Finish and report
   conclusion -> analysis_completed -> sanitized CodeRef/patch metadata
      -> HTML report + CLI artifacts + analysis-result snapshot
      -> /api/reports/:id
```

CLI `smp run` / `smp ask` / `smp compare` reuse the same session, runtime,
Skill, report, and trace-processor path. The difference is local storage under
`~/.smartperfetto/` and terminal output as `text`, `json`, or `ndjson`.

External Wiki context and trace evidence remain separate data flows. Prose can
enter the active provider tool result only under an explicit request capability;
runtime bridges project it to chunk references, hashes, licenses, and attribution
before SSE, logs, reports, or snapshots. The claim verifier must not treat Wiki
background as a measurement from the current trace.

## Runtime And Provider Boundaries

| Runtime | Providers | Key boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-agent-sdk` | Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex, Claude/Anthropic-compatible providers, local Claude Code fallback | Local Claude login only applies to source runs; Docker, portable, and npm CLI need explicit provider/env configuration |
| `openai-agents-sdk` | OpenAI, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible providers | Credentials and Responses/chat-completions protocol are validated by OpenAI runtime rules |
| `pi-agent-core` | Custom providers | Requires explicit Pi model JSON or equivalent env; does not read `.pi` project config, package extensions, shell tools, or file tools |
| `opencode` | Custom providers | Requires explicit OpenCode/OpenAI-compatible model config; uses an isolated OpenCode server and request-scoped MCP tools, not personal OpenCode login/project state |

Provider Manager active profiles override `.env` fallback. Resume must preserve
the original provider/runtime/comparison identity and must not silently switch
because the active provider changed later.

## AI Output Contract

The final answer is not a single Markdown string. It is a set of related
artifacts with different consumers:

| Artifact | Consumer | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Visible chat conclusion | Frontend AI panel | Readable, with low-value SQL/appendix/audit noise hidden |
| HTML report | Browser, export, sharing | Keeps evidence, claim verification, identity resolution, and appendix detail |
| CLI artifacts | `smp run`, `smp ask`, `smp capture --analyze`, `smp report` | Persists turns, reports, claim verification, and identity files |
| Analysis-result snapshot | Multi-result comparison and later review | Stores conclusion contract, claim support, verification, and identity metadata |

When fixing conclusion quality, identify the failing layer first: runtime
output, contract/gate, evidence/verification, report generation, snapshot, or
frontend projection. Do not make chat cleaner by deleting provenance required by
reports or snapshots.

## Comparison Modes

| Mode | Entry | Data source | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw Trace Compare | frontend reference trace, CLI `smp compare` | live current trace + reference trace queries | shared comparison identity, evidence pack, session snapshot, and report section |
| Analysis Result Compare | frontend multi-result comparison API | persisted completed-analysis snapshots | keeps workspace/RBAC/matrix behavior and reuses the shared report section |

For the Web UI dual trace workspace state machine, see
[Dual Trace Workspace Operation Model](dual-trace-workspace.en.md).

## Content Boundaries

| Content | Location | Runtime role |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy / prompt template | `backend/strategies/*.strategy.md`, `*.template.md` | Enters the system prompt and constrains agent behavior |
| YAML Skill | `backend/skills/**/*.skill.yaml` | Invoked through MCP `invoke_skill` for deterministic SQL analysis |
| Rendering pipeline catalog | `backend/skills/pipelines/index.yaml` | Pins the upstream commit and 14 document hashes, and classifies 31 detector entries as primary variants or supporting features |
| Rendering pipeline docs | `docs/rendering_pipelines/S01-S14*.md` | Authoritative Android 17 teaching material synchronized from `Gracker/rendering_pipelines`; copied to `backend/dist/rendering_pipelines/` during builds |
| Normal docs | Other files under `docs/` | User and contributor documentation |

Do not hardcode prompt content in TypeScript. TypeScript should load, substitute, and structurally orchestrate prompts and Skills.
Do not hardcode MCP tool counts, Skill counts, or scene counts in code or
durable docs; those come from the tool registry, `backend/skills/` tree, and
strategy frontmatter.

Rendering-pipeline results preserve two identities: S02-S14 are the teaching
`rendering type`, while the 31 pipeline entries are trace-detection subpaths or
features. Only entries marked `classification_role: variant` and
`primary_eligible: true` in the catalog may become the primary classification.
Run `npm run check:rendering-pipelines` to verify the upstream pin, hashes, and
all active references.
