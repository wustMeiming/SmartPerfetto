# Architecture Overview

[English](overview.en.md) | [中文](overview.md)

SmartPerfetto adds an AI analysis layer on top of Perfetto UI. Perfetto remains responsible for trace loading, timeline exploration, and SQL fundamentals; the SmartPerfetto backend handles agent orchestration, Skill execution, report generation, and streaming output.

```text
Frontend: Perfetto UI @ :10000
  └─ com.smartperfetto.AIAssistant plugin
       ├─ trace upload / open trace
       ├─ AI panel / floating window
       ├─ Codebase Config Panel
       ├─ DataEnvelope tables and charts
       └─ SSE client

Backend: Express @ :3000
  ├─ /api/agent/v1/*          main agent analysis path
  ├─ /api/traces/*            trace upload and lifecycle
  ├─ /api/rag/*               RAG and codebase management
  ├─ /api/skills/*            Skill query and execution
  ├─ /api/export/*            exports
  ├─ /api/reports/*           HTML reports
  └─ trace_processor_shell    HTTP RPC pool, 9100-9900

Standalone CLI: smp / smartperfetto
  └─ reuses the same backend runtime, Skills, SQL, sessions, reports, and comparison contract
```

## Product Entry Points And Release Forms

| Entry point | User form | Runtime boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Web UI | Docker, portable packages, source `./start.sh` | Calls the backend over HTTP/SSE and serves the committed `frontend/` prebuild |
| CLI | npm package `@gracker/smartperfetto` | Requires Node.js `>=24 <25`, does not start the Web UI, stores sessions/reports under `~/.smartperfetto/` |
| API/SSE | `/api/agent/v1/*` and related routes | Shared by the frontend and external integrations |
| Portable launcher | GitHub three-platform assets | Bundles Node.js 24, native deps, backend, `frontend/`, and `trace_processor_shell` |
| Docker | Docker Hub image | Linux container; does not read host Claude Code local auth |

Feature and bug designs must check Web UI, CLI, API, reports, Docker, portable
packages, runtime/provider behavior, pre-built content, and Node version
boundaries. The LLM/agent checklist is in
[`../../.claude/rules/product-surface.md`](../../.claude/rules/product-surface.md).

## Core Modules

| Module | Location | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Perfetto UI plugin | `perfetto/ui/src/plugins/com.smartperfetto.AIAssistant/` | Panel, SSE, result rendering, scene navigation, selection interaction |
| Express backend | `backend/src/index.ts` | Route registration, health checks, middleware, process cleanup |
| Runtime selector | `backend/src/agentRuntime/` | Chooses Claude Agent SDK or OpenAI Agents SDK for each session |
| Claude runtime | `backend/src/agentv3/` | Claude Agent SDK orchestration, MCP server, strategy injection, verifier, memory |
| OpenAI runtime | `backend/src/agentOpenAI/` | OpenAI Agents SDK orchestration behind the same assistant contract |
| Assistant application | `backend/src/assistant/` | Session management, stream projection, result contracts |
| Skill engine | `backend/src/services/skillEngine/` | YAML Skill loading, parameter substitution, SQL execution, DataEnvelope output |
| Skills | `backend/skills/` | Atomic, composite, deep, and rendering-pipeline analysis |
| Strategies | `backend/strategies/` | Scene strategies, prompt templates, knowledge templates |
| Code-aware analysis | `backend/src/services/codebase/`, `backend/src/services/rag/`, `backend/src/services/symbol/` | Local codebase registry, source ingestion, symbol resolution, lookup filtering, and patch status verification |
| Trace processor | `backend/src/services/traceProcessorService.ts` | Trace loading, RPC management, SQL query execution |
| Reports | `backend/src/services/htmlReportGenerator.ts` | HTML report generation |
| CLI | `backend/src/cli-user/` | `smp` / `smartperfetto` commands, session/history/report export |
| Comparison services | `backend/src/services/comparison*Service.ts` | Shared evidence/report contract for raw-trace and analysis-result comparison |

## Main Analysis Data Flow

```text
1. User loads a trace
   UI -> /api/traces/upload -> TraceProcessorService -> trace_processor_shell

2. User starts analysis
   UI -> POST /api/agent/v1/analyze
      -> AgentAnalyzeSessionService.prepareSession()
      -> selected runtime analyze()

3. Agent gathers evidence
   Runtime -> MCP tools
      -> execute_sql -> trace_processor_shell
      -> invoke_skill -> SkillExecutor -> SQL / DataEnvelope
      -> lookup_knowledge / lookup_sql_schema / fetch_artifact
      -> resolve_symbol / lookup_app_source / lookup_aosp_source / lookup_kernel_source
         -> LookupResponseFilter -> CodeRef metadata
      -> propose_patch -> PatchProposer -> verified / sketch / unverified

4. Backend streams output
   SDK events -> runtime bridge -> StreamProjector -> SSE
      -> frontend renders progress, tables, thoughts, answer tokens

5. Finish and report
   conclusion -> analysis_completed -> sanitized CodeRef/patch metadata
      -> HTML report -> /api/reports/:id
```

CLI `smp run` / `smp ask` / `smp compare` reuse the same session, runtime,
Skill, report, and trace-processor path. The difference is local storage under
`~/.smartperfetto/` and terminal output as `text`, `json`, or `ndjson`.

## Runtime And Provider Boundaries

| Runtime | Providers | Key boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `claude-agent-sdk` | Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex, Claude/Anthropic-compatible providers, local Claude Code fallback | Local Claude login only applies to source runs; Docker, portable, and npm CLI need explicit provider/env configuration |
| `openai-agents-sdk` | OpenAI, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible providers | Credentials and Responses/chat-completions protocol are validated by OpenAI runtime rules |

Provider Manager active profiles override `.env` fallback. Resume must preserve
the original provider/runtime/comparison identity and must not silently switch
because the active provider changed later.

## Comparison Modes

| Mode | Entry | Data source | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw Trace Compare | frontend reference trace, CLI `smp compare` | live current trace + reference trace queries | shared comparison identity, evidence pack, session snapshot, and report section |
| Analysis Result Compare | frontend multi-result comparison API | persisted completed-analysis snapshots | keeps workspace/RBAC/matrix behavior and reuses the shared report section |

## Content Boundaries

| Content | Location | Runtime role |
|---|---|---|
| Strategy / prompt template | `backend/strategies/*.strategy.md`, `*.template.md` | Enters the system prompt and constrains agent behavior |
| YAML Skill | `backend/skills/**/*.skill.yaml` | Invoked through MCP `invoke_skill` for deterministic SQL analysis |
| Rendering pipeline docs | `docs/rendering_pipelines/*.md` | Knowledge source for teaching mode and pipeline results |
| Normal docs | Other files under `docs/` | User and contributor documentation |

Do not hardcode prompt content in TypeScript. TypeScript should load, substitute, and structurally orchestrate prompts and Skills.
