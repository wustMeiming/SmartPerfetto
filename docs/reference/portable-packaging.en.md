# Portable Packaging

[English](portable-packaging.en.md) | [中文](portable-packaging.md)

SmartPerfetto portable packages are not single-file binaries. The launcher starts
the bundled Node.js 24 runtime, backend, pre-built Perfetto UI, and pinned
`trace_processor_shell`.

Current release assets:

- `smartperfetto-v<version>-windows-x64.zip`
- `smartperfetto-v<version>-macos-arm64.zip`
- `smartperfetto-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz`

## Build

```bash
npm run package:portable
```

Single target:

```bash
npm run package:windows-exe
npm run package:macos-app
npm run package:linux
```

Outputs:

```text
dist/portable/smartperfetto-v<version>-windows-x64.zip
dist/portable/smartperfetto-v<version>-macos-arm64.zip
dist/portable/smartperfetto-v<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz
```

The legacy-compatible Windows command still writes:

```text
dist/windows-exe/smartperfetto-v<version>-windows-x64.zip
```

## Release

See the [Release Runbook](release.en.md) for the full public release sequence.
Portable publishing normally happens after the npm CLI is published and smoked.

Portable steps in a normal public release:

```bash
npm run version:set -- 1.0.3
npm run version:sync -- --check
git add package.json package-lock.json backend/package.json backend/package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: release v1.0.3"
git push origin main
npm --prefix backend run cli:pack-check
npm --prefix backend publish --access public
npm run package:portable
npm run release:portable -- 1.0.3 --skip-build --no-draft
```

`package:portable` builds all three target packages and verifies manifests.
`release:portable --skip-build` reuses packages just built from the same version
and commit, uploads every target asset, and verifies the GitHub Release target
commit plus asset names. It creates a draft release by default; pass
`--no-draft` to publish immediately. Do not use `--skip-build` unless those
same-version, same-commit packages were just built.

Single-target release:

```bash
npm run release:portable -- 1.0.3 --targets macos-arm64
npm run release:windows-exe -- 1.0.3
```

Do not use `--allow-dirty` for public releases. If a major bug is found after
npm publish, fix it and publish a new patch version instead of reusing the
already-published npm version.

## macOS Signing and Notarization

Without signing variables, the script creates an ad-hoc signed app so macOS
does not classify the bundle as damaged. Ad-hoc signing does not pass
Gatekeeper notarization checks; it is only suitable for local testing or
packages where users can Control-click -> Open. For public macOS releases,
configure:

```bash
export SMARTPERFETTO_MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: ..."
export SMARTPERFETTO_MACOS_NOTARY_PROFILE="notarytool-keychain-profile"
npm run release:portable -- 1.0.3 --targets macos-arm64
```

When a signing identity is set, the script runs `codesign --options runtime` and
strict verification. When a notary profile is set, it submits with
`xcrun notarytool submit --wait`, staples the `.app`, and recreates the zip.

## User Data Directories

- Windows: package-local `data/` and `logs/`.
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/SmartPerfetto` and `~/Library/Logs/SmartPerfetto`.
- Linux: `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/smartperfetto` and
  `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/smartperfetto/logs`.

AI analysis should normally use Provider profiles configured in the UI. For env
credentials, create an `env` file in the platform user data directory and
restart the launcher.

The bundled launcher prefers backend `3000` and frontend `10000`. If a preferred
default port is already occupied, the launcher automatically selects the next
available port and prints the actual URLs. Set `SMARTPERFETTO_BACKEND_PORT` or
`SMARTPERFETTO_FRONTEND_PORT` only when a fixed port is required; explicitly
configured ports fail fast when unavailable.

## Verification

The scripts verify package structure, version, manifest, Node runtime, target
native dependencies, and the `trace_processor_shell` pin. Before a public
release, still run a target-platform smoke test:

1. Start the bundled launcher.
2. Open the printed frontend URL, usually [http://localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000).
3. Check the printed backend health URL, usually [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health).
4. Upload a small trace and confirm the platform `trace_processor_shell` starts
   in backend logs.
