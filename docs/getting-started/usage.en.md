## Recommended Trace Content

SmartPerfetto works best with Android 12+ traces, especially traces that include FrameTimeline data. Common atrace categories:

| Scene | Minimum categories | Useful extras |
|---|---|---|
| Scrolling | `gfx`, `view`, `input`, `sched` | `binder_driver`, `freq`, `disk` |
| Startup | `am`, `dalvik`, `wm`, `sched` | `binder_driver`, `freq`, `disk` |
| ANR | `am`, `wm`, `sched`, `binder_driver` | `dalvik`, `disk` |
| GPU / rendering | `gfx`, `view`, `sched` | `freq`, `gpu`, `binder_driver` |

## UI Analysis Flow

1. Open `http://localhost:10000`.
2. Load a `.pftrace` or `.perfetto-trace` file.
3. Open the SmartPerfetto AI Assistant panel.
4. Choose an analysis mode: fast, full, or auto.
5. Ask a natural-language question.
6. Wait for SSE streaming output, table evidence, and the final conclusion.

Auto mode first returns a scene inventory for mixed-action traces. The timeline lists detected startup, scrolling, click, navigation, device-state, ANR, and related scenes, then shows scope buttons. Select all scenes or one scene family before SmartPerfetto runs the matching startup, scrolling, click, or other deep-dive analysis.

## Common Prompt Templates

```text
Analyze scrolling jank
Analyze startup performance
Analyze this ANR
What is the app package name and main process in this trace?
Why is the main thread blocked in my selected range?
Compare scrolling behavior between this trace and the reference trace
Compare with the other result
Compare AR-1234abcd
```

## Live Raw Trace Comparison

To query two raw traces in one conversation, click `compare_arrows` in the AI
Assistant header, open the current + reference dual view, and select one
workspace-history trace. You can then refer to current/reference or use the
actual left/right/top/bottom layout.

Dual view supports the current page trace plus one history reference, not two
arbitrary history traces. Closing the visual dual view may retain AI comparison
context; `Exit Comparison` clears the reference. The CLI equivalent is:

```bash
smp compare current.pftrace reference.pftrace \
  --query "Compare startup and scrolling" --mode full
```

See [Dual Trace Workspace](../architecture/dual-trace-workspace.en.md) for the
full state model.

## Multi-Trace Analysis Result Comparison

After AI analysis has completed on two or more traces, you can type `Compare with the other result` in the AI input. When the current window has a latest analysis result and there is exactly one clear other candidate in the same workspace, SmartPerfetto uses the current result as the baseline and starts the comparison automatically.

Each completed AI analysis shows a `Result ID` next to the result title, such as `AR-1234abcd`. If more than one candidate exists, or you want to specify the target, say `Compare AR-1234abcd`. You can also say `Compare AR-11111111 and AR-22222222`; when multiple IDs are present, the first ID is the baseline and the later IDs are candidates.

You can also use the AI Assistant toolbar's `fact_check` entry to open analysis result comparison. Select one `Baseline` and one or more `Candidate` results; SmartPerfetto returns standard metric deltas, significant-change summary, and an HTML comparison report.

This compares completed analysis results and does not require the other Perfetto UI window to stay open. See [Multi-Trace Analysis Result Comparison](multi-trace-result-comparison.en.md) for the full workflow.

## Analysis Mode Selection

| Mode | Good for | Avoid for |
|---|---|---|
| Fast | Package name, process name, trace overview, simple facts | Heavy analysis such as startup or scrolling jank |
| Full | Startup, scrolling, ANR, complex rendering root cause | A single simple fact query |
| Auto | Mixed-script traces where you want to inspect scenes before choosing a deep-dive scope | Cases where you already know the single scene and want to run full analysis directly |

Fast mode defaults to 50 turns and can be overridden by runtime-specific
quick-turn configuration. Heavy Skills can still exhaust the budget, so
complex investigations should use full mode.

## Selection and Follow-Up

The frontend sends area selections or track-event selections to the backend as `selectionContext`. Good prompts include:

```text
Only inspect my selected time range. Why did the UI thread slow down?
Is there a Binder or scheduling problem around this slice?
```

Follow-up questions reuse the current session. Switching between fast, full, and auto starts a new SDK session so lightweight and full contexts do not mix.

## Source And Android Internals Background

- To map trace findings to local source, register through UI `Codebases` or
  `smp codebase preview/register/reindex`, then select the codebase explicitly
  for the analysis.
- The built-in Android Internals Knowledge Pack ships with the product. Use
  `smp knowledge-pack status`, or `update --check` to check without installing.
- A private Android Internals checkout is separate from the built-in Pack and
  requires a path allowlist, rights acknowledgement, provider consent, and a
  request-selected source id.

Source and background knowledge do not replace current-trace SQL/Skill
evidence. Code-Aware defaults to `CodeRef` metadata. See
[Code-Aware](code-aware-analysis.en.md) and
[Android Internals Knowledge](android-internals-knowledge.en.md).

## CLI Batch And Android Capture

Deterministic batch analysis does not require an LLM:

```bash
smp batch skill startup_analysis launch-a.pftrace launch-b.pftrace \
  --json-out batch.json --out batch.html
```

For Android capture, generate a side-effect-free proposal/config before using a
connected device:

```bash
smp capture suggest "Analyze Camera open-to-first-preview latency" \
  --app com.example.camera
smp capture config --preset camera --app com.example.camera \
  --duration 20 --out camera.pbtxt
smp capture android --config camera.pbtxt --out camera.perfetto-trace
```

`suggest` and `config` do not access a device; only `capture android` records
through adb/tracebox. See the [CLI Reference](../reference/cli.en.md) for
platform and `--analyze` boundaries.

## Reading Output

SmartPerfetto answers usually contain three evidence types:

- SQL results directly from `trace_processor_shell`.
- Skill results from YAML analysis pipelines under `backend/skills/`, rendered in L1-L4 layers.
- Agent conclusions based on SQL, Skills, strategies, and verifier output.

The conclusion should trace back to tables, time ranges, threads, slices, or Skill results. Suggestions that are not supported by trace data should not be treated as confirmed findings.

## Generated Reports

After agent analysis completes, the backend generates an HTML report. The UI reads the report through `/api/agent/v1/:sessionId/report`; the general report endpoint is `/api/reports/:reportId`.
