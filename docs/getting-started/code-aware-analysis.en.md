# Code-Aware Analysis

[English](code-aware-analysis.en.md) | [中文](code-aware-analysis.md)

Code-Aware Analysis lets SmartPerfetto reference local source trees while analyzing a trace. It maps app frames, native frames, and kernel symbols to `CodeRef` metadata. By default, outputs include only `chunkId`, relative file path, line range, and symbol. Raw source excerpts are fetched only through the RBAC-protected excerpt endpoint and are not persisted into sessions, reports, or exports.

## Enable It

1. Start the backend with `./start.sh`.
2. Open AI Assistant settings in Perfetto UI and select `Codebases`.
3. Add a codebase and run preview first.
4. Register it and run reindex.
5. Use code-aware mode in analysis, or pass `--code-aware metadata_only|provider_send` and `--codebase-id <id>` in the CLI.

CLI example:

```bash
cd backend
npm run cli -- codebase register /path/to/app \
  --name MyApp \
  --kind app_source \
  --path-filter app/src/main/ \
  --dry-run

npm run cli -- codebase register /path/to/app \
  --name MyApp \
  --kind app_source \
  --path-filter app/src/main/

npm run cli -- codebase reindex cb_xxx
npm run cli -- codebase symbols MainActivity --codebase-id cb_xxx

npm run cli -- run --format json \
  --code-aware metadata_only \
  --codebase-id cb_xxx \
  ../Trace/real/android-startup-heavy/trace.pftrace \
  "Find the startup bottleneck and map it to source code"
```

Registered codebases and knowledge sources are never exposed to a session automatically. The effective combinations are:

| Current selection | Effective behavior |
|---|---|
| No IDs | Normal trace-only path; `fast` can remain lightweight |
| `--codebase-id` only | Defaults to `metadata_only` and uses the full analysis runtime |
| `--code-aware metadata_only` + codebase ID | Uses `CodeRef` metadata only, with the full runtime |
| `--code-aware provider_send` + codebase ID | Sends filtered snippets only after dual consent, with the full runtime |
| `--code-aware off` + codebase ID | Invalid input; the source selection is rejected instead of silently ignored |
| `--knowledge-source-id` only | Uses the authorized private external RAG source and the full runtime |
| Codebase ID + knowledge source ID | Uses source and external RAG together under the same privacy projection and full runtime |

“Full runtime” means that an explicit `--analysis-mode fast` is resolved to `full` whenever source, private RAG, or a reference trace is selected, so capabilities are not silently dropped by a lightweight path. `provider_send` requires two independent authorizations: `--send-to-provider` at codebase registration and `--code-aware provider_send` for the current run.

## Supported Codebases

| kind | Use | Required metadata |
|---|---|---|
| `app_source` | App Java/Kotlin/R8 lookup | root path, optional build-id / commit / path-filter |
| `aosp` | AOSP framework/native hot paths | `licenseTag`, recommended build-id and commit |
| `kernel_source` | kernel binder/scheduler/mm/io causes | `vendor`, `path-filter` or `pathPrefix`, SPDX or license tag |
| `oem_sdk` | OEM / chipset SDK material | vendor and license, behind the same security gates |

## Security Boundary

- `metadata_only`: the model sees only `CodeRef` metadata, not source snippets.
- `provider_send`: snippets can be sent only for codebases registered with `sendToProvider` consent.
- Raw queries, intermediate reasoning, tool arguments, and retrieved text from private source/knowledge runs are not persisted to sessions, logs, reports, or exports. Claude local transcripts and OpenAI Responses storage are disabled, and cross-session pattern, verifier, and SQL-fix learning is neither read nor written. Final conclusions and deterministic trace evidence pass through one shared privacy projection; bounded in-process session context provides multi-turn continuity.
- Legacy RAG chunks keep their existing behavior; `app_source`, `kernel_source`, or `registryOrigin=codebase_registry` chunks without codebase metadata fail closed.
- Legacy `/api/rag/chunks/:id` and `/api/rag/search` return sanitized hash/length data for code-aware chunks, not source text.
- Web UI “Delete codebase” revokes retrieval and provider consent before removing every indexed generation in the current scope; interrupted deletion is safe to retry. Local deletion cannot recall content already sent to a provider.
- Patch proposals have three states: `verified`, `sketch`, and `unverified`. `sketch` and `unverified` never expose a copyable diff.

## Verification

Common checks:

```bash
cd backend
npm run verify:codebase-aware
```

The local full E2E uses:

- `Trace/real/android-startup-heavy/trace.pftrace`
- `Trace/real/android-startup-light/trace.pftrace`
- `/Users/chris/Code/HighPerformanceFriendsCircle`

The E2E covers both paths:

- No codebase configured for the session: Light trace completes normally and the report has no `CodeRef` / code-aware section.
- HighPerformanceFriendsCircle configured for the session: Heavy/Light traces complete normally and reports/exports contain `CodeRef` entries such as relative `MainActivity.kt` and `LoadSimulator.kt` file paths with line ranges; reports must not contain the absolute root path or raw source text.

Override paths when needed:

```bash
SMARTPERFETTO_E2E_HEAVY_TRACE=/path/heavy.pftrace \
SMARTPERFETTO_E2E_LIGHT_TRACE=/path/light.pftrace \
SMARTPERFETTO_E2E_APP_REPO=/path/HighPerformanceFriendsCircle \
npm --prefix backend run verify:codebase-aware
```
