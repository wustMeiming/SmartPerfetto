# §0.4.3 Trace Processor RSS Benchmark Runbook

## Goal

This runbook defines the evidence required before README §0.4.3 can be treated
as strictly measured release evidence. The benchmark must measure
trace_processor_shell memory behavior for large enterprise traces and feed the
later §0.4.7 RAM budget / admission-control work.

User-deferred external validation: yes

On 2026-05-09 the maintainer explicitly deferred the real large-trace matrix to
a later manual run. For this agent handoff, the harness, matrix audit, and local
candidate scan are complete; the missing 17 scene/size cells remain external
measured evidence to be filled by the maintainer. This marker is only accepted
by `enterprise:readiness-audit` when
`--allow-user-deferred-external-evidence` is passed.

Required matrix:

| Scene | Required size buckets |
| --- | --- |
| scroll | 100MB, 500MB, 1GB |
| startup | 100MB, 500MB, 1GB |
| ANR | 100MB, 500MB, 1GB |
| memory | 100MB, 500MB, 1GB |
| heapprofd | 100MB, 500MB, 1GB |
| vendor | 100MB, 500MB, 1GB |

Each successful run records:

- startup RSS: first sampled child-process RSS after trace_processor_shell spawn
- load peak: maximum RSS observed before the processor is ready
- post-load RSS: RSS after initialization and before representative queries
- query peak: maximum RSS while the representative query set runs
- query incremental RSS: query peak minus post-load RSS
- query headroom: host total memory minus query peak

## Command

First audit whether the machine has enough candidate traces for the required
matrix. This command does not start `trace_processor_shell` and is not RSS
benchmark evidence; it only prevents local trace discovery from being an
untracked manual `find` step:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.15.0/bin:$PATH" \
  npm run benchmark:trace-rss:audit -- \
  --scan-dir /path/to/large-trace-directory \
  --output test-output/trace-processor-rss-matrix-audit.json \
  --markdown test-output/trace-processor-rss-matrix-audit.md \
  --benchmark-manifest test-output/trace-processor-rss-benchmark-manifest.json \
  --require-complete-matrix
```

`--require-complete-matrix` exits non-zero until every scene/size candidate cell
exists. A passing audit is only permission to run the benchmark below; it does
not complete §0.4.3 by itself.

The audit recognizes `.trace`, `.pftrace`, `.perfetto-trace`, `.pb`, and
`.protobuf` files.

`--benchmark-manifest` writes the benchmark manifest only when every required
scene/size cell has at least one candidate. For duplicate candidates in a cell,
the largest trace is selected.

Run from `backend/` with Node 24:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.15.0/bin:$PATH" \
  npm run benchmark:trace-rss -- \
  --manifest test-output/trace-processor-rss-benchmark-manifest.json \
  --output test-output/trace-processor-rss-benchmark.json \
  --markdown test-output/trace-processor-rss-benchmark.md \
  --require-complete-matrix
```

The `--require-complete-matrix` flag is required for final §0.4.3 evidence. It
exits non-zero when any scene/size cell is missing, so smoke runs cannot be
mistaken for an acceptance run. Omit it only when validating the harness with
partial local traces.

The script also supports ad-hoc traces:

```bash
PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.15.0/bin:$PATH" \
  npm run benchmark:trace-rss -- \
  --trace scroll=/path/to/scroll-500mb.pftrace \
  --trace startup=/path/to/startup-1gb.pftrace
```

Manifest shape:

```json
{
  "traces": [
    {
      "scene": "scroll",
      "label": "scroll-500mb-device-a",
      "path": "/absolute/or/manifest-relative/path.pftrace"
    }
  ]
}
```

The script classifies trace sizes from file size:

- `under-100MB`: below 100 MiB; useful for smoke only, does not satisfy §0.4.3
- `100MB`: at least 100 MiB and below 500 MiB
- `500MB`: at least 500 MiB and below 1 GiB
- `1GB`: at least 1 GiB

## Current Local Trace Audit

As of 2026-05-08, the repository checkout only has small local fixtures:

| Trace | Size | In §0.4.3 matrix |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `test-traces/lacunh_heavy.pftrace` | 18 MiB | no, smoke only |
| `test-traces/scroll-demo-customer-scroll.pftrace` | 14 MiB | no, smoke only |
| `test-traces/Scroll-Flutter-SurfaceView-Wechat-Wenyiwen.pftrace` | 12 MiB | no, smoke only |
| `test-traces/launch_light.pftrace` | 10 MiB | no, smoke only |
| `test-traces/Scroll-Flutter-327-TextureView.pftrace` | 7 MiB | no, smoke only |
| `test-traces/scroll_Standard-AOSP-App-Without-PreAnimation.pftrace` | 6.3 MiB | no, smoke only |

These smoke traces can validate the benchmark harness, but they cannot provide
strict measured §0.4.3 release evidence. Treat README §0.4.3 as agent-scope
complete only under the maintainer-deferred mode until the required 18
scene/size cells above are covered by real benchmark output.

Additional local audit on 2026-05-09 found three real startup traces under
`/Users/chris/Code/SmartPerfetto/Trace/`, each in the 100MB bucket. They were
benchmarked and recorded in `baseline.md`, covering only `startup:100MB`.
The required matrix still lacks the remaining 17 cells, so strict measured
§0.4.3 release evidence remains deferred on collecting representative scroll,
ANR, memory, heapprofd, vendor, 500MB, and 1GB traces.

A broader candidate audit on 2026-05-09 scanned:

- `/Users/chris/Code/SmartPerfetto/Trace`
- `/Users/chris/traces`
- `/Users/chris/tools/perfetto_shell/trace`
- `/Users/chris/SynologyDrive/技术分享/2024-Google-Extended-IO-Chengdu/Perfetto-Trace`
- `/Users/chris/Code/HighPerformanceFriendsCircle/perfetto-trace`

It still found only the three `startup:100MB` candidates above. The largest
non-startup traces on this machine are below the 100MB bucket, so they remain
smoke inputs rather than §0.4.3 evidence.
