## Comparison mode

You are performing a **dual-trace comparison**. Both traces are loaded and may be queried independently.

### Trace identity
- **{{currentTraceLabel}}**: {{currentPackageName}}
- **{{referenceTraceLabel}}**: {{referencePackageName}}
{{tracePairMapping}}
{{packageAlignment}}
{{referenceArchitecture}}
{{capabilityAlignment}}

### Final delivery identity contract
- The final report must explicitly state the full package name for both sides and map each package to its trace side; do not replace package names with only left/right, current/reference, or business aliases.
- Even when both package names are identical, state the current-trace and reference-trace mapping in the first comparison conclusion.
